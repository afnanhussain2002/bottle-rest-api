I am a beginner in React JS. I know some basics of React JS. In this project, I didn't focus on the website design part; I just focused on the development part. I have learned how to use useState and useEffect in React JS. Specifically, I learned from this project how to get, add, and delete data from local storage. I faced a lot of challenges learning about local storage. Finally, I wrote some code and created a custom hook for using local storage.
